# ChatGPT 4o

## Prompt 1:
You are an expert frontend web developer. Create a simple web application that will emulate a stopwatch for this create the files index.html for the visual layout and script.js for the logic.
The web application will contain a centered round corner box with the timer in a format HH:MM:SS with a bottom right small ZZZ in a black font and with a blue-grayish background color for the whole box and just below it to the left a green background color button with the same formatted rounded corners that will start the timer and stop it when pressed again, this button is labeled Start to start it and Stop to stop it. And to the right of it, a red background color button to reset the timer to 00:00:00.000 that will also have this rounded corners. All buttons will have a dark gray border color of medium size (not 1px).
Let me know if you have any questions before proceeding with the implementation.

## Prompt 2:
Modify the html to separate the timer and buttons in 3 containers. Timer on top, buttons below the timer with the same alignment. Also modify the reset button label to Clear and the timer will be shown in 2 levels Upper level is the timer itself in HH:MM:SS and the bottom level is the milliseconds ZZZ. So for example the timer will start at 00:00:00 and the milliseconds at the bottom of it with a smaller font size aligned to the right of it so in the digit of the timer just below with a 000. Also make the timer itself font a lot bigger, like 2.2x the size.

## Prompt 3:
Make the green for the start button more vibrant and the red a little more opaque and their round corners less rounded, also make the font color black and take these buttons outside the main container just below it, in their own containers each keeping the positioning. Increase font size of the timer to 2x again and the milliseconds place it just below the last second and make them smaller (to occupy the entire last digit but just below it).

## Prompt 4: (attached screenshot)
Make the start and clear buttons bigger in width increasing their padding left and right. Make the timer font size occupy the entire space is containing with a similar padding left and right. Position the milliseconds in the right side of the timer is now currently being displayed centered.

## Prompt 5: (attached screenshot)
Remove the stopwatch container, leave only the timer container, also the milliseconds moved outside the container which is wrong. The layout will be the light blue grey timer with the timer itself and just below the last digit the milliseconds part. And the 2 buttons are well positioned so no need to make changes to this. Add an improvement and make the Start button color yellow when its action is stop.

## Prompt 6: (attached screenshot)
Reduce top visual space in the timer to half, make the milliseconds font 2x bigger and fix their position more to the top so it doesn’t overlap with the border.

## Prompt 7: (attached screenshot)
Reduce padding top to 3px on timer and milliseconds bottom to 4px.

## Prompt 8: (attached screenshot)
Adjust timer and milliseconds spacing not to overlap, keep the rest of the layout similar.

## Prompt 9: (attached screenshot)
Its now overlapping more, add at least 1px vertical space separation between the timer and the milliseconds.

## Prompt 10:
Create a markdown document with this project.
